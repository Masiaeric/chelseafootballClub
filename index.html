            <p>There have been upsets and difficult challenges along the way as well that only add to the intrigue,
                 and by visiting The Story of Chelsea below, each twist and turn is recalled chapter by chapter.</p>

            <p>In 2016, the Academy was awarded Category One status following an independent audit by the
                 Premier League.</p>

               <p> The audit process forms part of the Leagueâ€™s monitoring of the Elite Player Performance Plan 
                   (EPPP), created in 2012 and designed to increase the quantity and quality of homegrown
                    English players. The categorisation system permits the best-ranked academies more
                     contact time with young players and ensures their development teams participate
                      in the elite competitions at youth level.</p>
                      <p> Up to 10 different factors are considered in the grading including productivity rates, 
                       training facilities, coaching, welfare and education provisions.
                       The Academy teams compete in an extensive games programme in the Professional
                        Development Phase (Under-17+).
                         These are split between the Under-18s, Under-19s and development squad, 
                         with the latter two generally formed of the same group of
                          players and coaching staff</p>
